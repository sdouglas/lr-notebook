        The path drawing is *EXTREMELY* buggy.  You have to zoom in on the path before it draws the crossovers (not sure why the initial refresh isn&#39;t working).  The coordinates of where the scaffold crossovers are drawn are totally messed up (I didn&#39;t plan carefully and was trying to accommodate re-scaling from the start... probably need to re-think things). Also, if you try to add more than two helices, it basically crashes.

However, the exciting thing is that I have the basic data structures in place and just need to work out the kinks, and then we can start adding real functionality.  Each &#34;path&#34; holds the virtual strand helix information (both scaffold and staple), and each segment within a virtual strand is its own data structure (PathSegment), which holds the actual crossover positions, caps, loops, etc.. So the complete structure (pathList) is a doubly-linked list of paths, and each path is itself a doubly-linked list of PathSegments.

The highest priority should probably be getting this slice/path interface to the point where we can design with it (and output XML for downstream applications).

I feel like the 3D stuff won&#39;t be that difficult.  In a way it&#39;s just a slight rearrangement of the coordinates that you get when you create the slice and path interfaces.  That probably means that it shouldn&#39;t be written until we have the 2D stuff finished.

The issue I&#39;m currently working on is designing a path drawing algorithm so it&#39;s not completely buggy and actually draws things with the proper coordinates.  So far I have been trying to draw some P0 crossovers (vertical lines).  Part of the problem is that I made things too complicated by trying to incorporate some parameter-based scaling.  I&#39;m going to re-write things to use a fixed coordinate system and and then adjust scaleX and scaleY to get zooming.
