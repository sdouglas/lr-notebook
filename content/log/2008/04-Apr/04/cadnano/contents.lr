# Researched MS Silverlight as platform for cadnano

- Silverlight is a browser plugin similar to Flash which allows creation of rich web applications
 - Advantages: supports Python instead of Actionscript.
 - Disadvantages: No 3D yet. MS- and Windows-centric (.NET, Visual Studio, etc). Would require a lot of work to switch.
